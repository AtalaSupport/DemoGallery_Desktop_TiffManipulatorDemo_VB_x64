# TiffMaipulatorDemo
Demonstrates page manipulation on TIFF Files including features such as reorder pages, 
remove pages, combine multiple files, and save the result. It uses our ThumbnailView 
to provide a visual UI for reordering / selecting pages

"Under the hood", this demo demonstrates how to manipulate pages in a TIFF, and resave 
without having to recompose the entire TIFF. Includes the ability to reoder pages, 
remove pages, merge multiple TIFF files, and save the result.

This is the VB.NET version. We also have a [C# version](https://github.com/AtalaSupport/DemoGallery_Desktop_TiffManipulatorDemo_CS_x64).

## Instructions
PDF Manipulator is a tool used for combining pages from different PDF files into a new PDF file.

### Adding Pages:
To get started, click the File menu and select the Add Files… menu item.  Each page of the PDF file will be shown as a thumbnail and its filename is listed in the control on the right side of the window.  Additional files can be added to the existing thumbnails using this same procedure.

### Reordering Pages:
You can reorder the pages by dragging the thumbnails with your mouse.  An indicator is shown between the pages where the page you’re dragging will be inserted once the mouse button is released.

### Removing Pages:
To remove a page, select the page thumbnail with your mouse and press the Delete key on your keyboard.  To remove all pages from a file that was added, select the filename from the list on the right and press the Delete key on your keyboard.

### Saving the Result:
To save these pages as a multipage PDF, click the File menu and select the Save As… menu item.  This will bring up a dialog so you can choose where to save the image and its filename.


## Licensing
This application requires a license for DotImage Document Imaging. You may request a 30 day evaulation if youre evaluating if DotImage / our OCR is right for you.


## SDK Dependencies
This app was built based on 2026.2.0.0. It targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 and was created in Visual Studio 2022. You must have our SDK installed (and licesed per above)

[Download DotImage](https://www.atalasoft.com/BeginDownload/DotImageDownloadPage)


### Using NuGet for SDK Dependencies
We do publish our SDK components to NuGet. We have chosen to base the demo on local installed SDK because this leads to much smaller applications (NuGet packages add a lot of overhead due to the way they're packaged and deployed, and many of our demos -- including this one -- are often used to reproduce issues that need to be submitted to support. Apps that use NuGet are often significantly larger and run up against our maximum support case upload size)

Still, if you wish to use NuGet for the dependencies instead of relying on locally installed SDK, you can.

- Take note of each of the references we've included:
    - Atalasoft.DotImage.dll
    - Atalasoft.DotImage.AdvancedDocClean.dll
    - Atalasoft.DotImage.Lib.dll
    - Atalasoft.DotImage.WinControls.dll
    - Atalasoft.PdfDoc.dll
    - Atalasoft.Shared.dll
- Remove those referneces
- Open the NuGet Package Manger from `Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Manage NuGet Packages for this Solution`
- Browse for and install  Atalasoft.DotImage.WinControls.x64 - It will pull in DotImage Document Imaging (the base SDK) and our windows controls and shared dll
